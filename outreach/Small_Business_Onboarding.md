# Small-Business Onboarding â€” A Useful Neighbor

**Lead with value**
- Foot traffic from events / directory placement
- Co-promotion (posters, QR, \"mesh partner\" window cling)
- If desired later: provide rooftop/indoor space for sensors/APs

**3-slide pitch**
1. Who we are (community-led)
2. What we do (projects + directory)
3. What you get (visibility + voice)

**Follow-up**
- Add their Entity card; confirm contact; schedule forum intro.

# Resident Onboarding — Welcome, Listen, Invite

**Principles:** plain language, short asks, visible wins.

**Quick paths**
- QR to Mesh Map; invite to add a local place they love (Entity card).
- “Start a card” table at events (facilitator helps create cards/issues).
- Opt-in email list for forum invites; no spam; monthly digest.

**Checklist**
- [ ] 1-pager (what is the mesh? how to join)
- [ ] Feedback notebook or web form
- [ ] Photograph consent signs for events (see Consent_Privacy_Guide.md)

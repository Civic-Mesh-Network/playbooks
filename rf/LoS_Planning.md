# Line-of-Sight (LoS) Planning â€” v0
1) Identify anchors (roofs/poles). Measure heights; verify Fresnel clearance.
2) Prefer 60 GHz for short hi-throughput hops; add 5 GHz failover.
3) Document coords, height, azimuth, tilt, channel plan.
4) Record RSSI/MCS/throughput; photo before/after; monitor latency/loss.
5) Compliance: ISED CA country code, EIRP limits, safe mounting & bonding.
